# SciTIF

**SciTIF is a .NET library for working with scientific imaging data.** Many libraries that read TIF files struggle to interpret 16-bit and 32-bit TIF files used for scientific imaging. If you've ever tried to open a scientific TIF file in Windows Photo Viewer and been presented with a black square, you've experienced this problem too!
